    "Or, how you can extract meaningful information from raw text and use it to analyze the networks of individuals hidden within your data set.\n",

    "We are all drowning in text. Fortunately there are a number of data science strategies for handling the deluge. If you'd like to learn about using machine learning for this check out my [guide on document clustering](http://brandonrose.org/clustering). In this guide I'm going to walk you through a strategy for making sense of massive troves of unstructured text using entity extration and network analysis. These strategies are actively employed for legal e-discovery and within law enforcement and the intelligence community. Imagine you work at the FBI and you just uncovered a massive trove of documents on a confiscated laptop or server. What would you do? This guide offers an approach for dealing with this type of scenario. By the end of it you'll have generated a graph like the one above, which you can use to analyze the network hidden within your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going take a set of documents (in our case, news articles), extract entities from within them, and develop a social network based on entity document co-occurrence. This can be a useful approach for getting a sense of which entities exist in a set of documents and how those entities might be related. I'll talk more about using document co-occurrence as the mechanism for drawing an edge in a social network graph later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide I rely on 4 primary pieces of software:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stanford Core NLP\n",
    "2. Fuzzywuzzy\n",
    "3. Networkx\n",
    "4. D3.js\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not familiar with these libraries, don't worry, I'll make it easy to get off to the races with them in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that my [github repo](https://github.com/brandomr/ner2sna) for the whole project is available. You can use `corpus.txt` as a sample data set if you'd like. Also, make sure to capture the `force` directory when you try to run this on your own. You need `force/force.html`, `force/force.css`, and `force/force.js` in order to create the chart at the end of the guide.\n",

    "## Installing CoreNLP with Docker\n",
    "First, we need to get Core NLP running on Docker. If you're not familiar with Docker, that's ok! It's an easy to use containerization service. The concept is that anywhere you can run docker you can run a docker container. Period. No need to worry about dependency management, just get docker running and pull down the container you need. Easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stanford Core NLP** is one of the most popular natural language processing tools out there. It has a ton of functionality which includes part of speech tagging, parsing, lemmatization, tokenization, and what we are interested in: **named entity recognition (NER)**. NER is the process of analyzing text in order to find people, places, and organizations contained within the text. These named entities will form the basis of the rest of our analysis, so being able to extract them from text is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Docker\n",
    "Docker now has great installation instructions (trust me, this wasn't always the case). I'm using a Mac so I followed their [Mac OSX Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). If you're using Windows check out their [Windows install guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). If you're using Linux I'm pretty sure you'll be able to get Docker installed on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the installation was successful go to your command line and try running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should an empty docker listing that looks like (I truncated a couple columns, but you get the idea):\n",
    "```\n",
    "CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED\n",
    "```      \n",
    "If this isn't empty you already had docker running with a container. If you are not able to run the `docker` or `docker ps` commands from your command line, **STOP**. You need to get this installed before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Core NLP container\n",
    "This part is pretty easy. You just need to run the following command at your command line:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -p 9000:9000 --name coreNLP --rm -i -t motiz88/corenlp\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will pull motiz88's Docker port of Core NLP and run it using port 9000. This means that port 9000 from the container will be forwarded to port 9000 on your localhost (your computer). So, you can access the Core NLP API over `http://localhost:9000`. Note that this is a fairly large container so it may take a few minutes to download and install.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that the server is running, in your browser go to http://localhost:9000. You should see:\n",
    "![Stanford Core NLP Server](core_nlp_server.png \"Core NLP Server\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't, don't move forward until you can verify the Core NLP server is running. You might try `docker ps` to see if the container is listed. If it is, you can scope out the logs with `docker logs coreNLP`. If it *is* running feel free to play around with the server UI. Input some text to get a feel for how it works!"

That said, we need to be able to identify the people that the `ner` or Named Entity Recognition module discovered. So, let's go ahead and define a function which takes a set of sentence tokens and finds the tokens which were labeled as `PERSON`. This gets a little tricky as individual tokens can be labeled as `PERSON` when they actually correspond to the same person. For example, the tokens `Jean`, `Claude`, `van`, and `Dam` all correspond to the same person. So, the function below take `tokens` which are contiguous (next to one another) within the same sentence and combines them into the same person entity. Perfect!\n",
